## How to add sources

These files are based on the RTL Kernel Wizard output.
First run the RTL Kernel Wizard with the exact same settings outlined in the [kernel.xml](ip/kernel.xml).
If successful, the skeleton Vivado project will be the same for most of the source files located in [src/](src/)
The RTL Kernel Wizard tips are located [here](https://github.com/sgnoohc/aws-fpga-notes/blob/master/README.md).

Once the Vivado project is open proceed to add the .xci IP cores that I created for this RTL kernel.
Click on '+' icon in the "Sources" tab.
Add the .xci files under the [ip/](ip/)
